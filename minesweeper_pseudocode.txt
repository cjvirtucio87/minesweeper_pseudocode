Grid
- 2d array
- each index of a row => y coord
- each index of a first row => x coord
- size can scale

Cell
- (y,x)
- is_bomb? => bool
- count_bombs_around
- ... call is_bomb? on adjacent cells
- ... determines number for cell's marker
- ask grid for questions..
- e.g. Cell@(2,2).count_bombs_around => (1,1); (1,2); ...


Grid
- before game even starts, grid will call every_cell_count method
- ... tells every cell in grid to count bombs around it (count_bombs_around)
- ..... save result in an instance variable(attr_reader)
- needs to be able to randomize bomb placement
- ... basis: range(1,number) of cells (e.g. sample(10))
- include Enumerable
- ... call each on self => enumerating through all cells
- ... e.g. grid.each => iterate through all cells
- ... 2d array
- ...... for each array, iterate through sub-arrays
- ...... return original array
